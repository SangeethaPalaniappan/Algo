Hash Table :

Operations      - Insertion, Deletion and Searching
Time Complexity - O(1) [for all Operations]
Hash Table is used only when the size of the array is small 
else the space complextiy becomes larger

Closed Hashing [Open addressing] - The element placed other than its calculated address
    *Linear Probing
    *Quadratic Probing
    *Double Probing
    *+3 rehash

Open Hashing [Separate Chaining] - Collision avoidance method - 
                                   the elements that are placed in the array of linkedlist

Time Complexity - O(1) in the best case
                - O(n) in the worst case
